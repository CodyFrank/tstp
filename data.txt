Hello, World!
First time ever using vim. I think this is very cool and much worth looking into further. 

remember vim file name will open or create that file in command mode. 
press i to enter insert mode and type

press esp then a colon to enter last line mode when finished typeing 

finally type x to save or q to quit without saveing

type vimtutor for vims built in tutorial
